  /// no one returned true.
  ///
  /// This is useful for figuring out who is claiming a gesture event.
  /// Example: SelectNearest returns true for onTapTest if the point is within
  /// the drawArea. SeriesLegend returns true for onTapTest if the point is
  /// within the legend. If the tap occurs in either of those places the
  /// corresponding listener. If the tap occurs outside of both targets, then

  /// Defaults to function that returns false allowing other listeners to preempt.

  /// the user is dragging.
  ///
  /// This will only be called once per drag gesture independent of how many
  /// touches are going on until the last touch is complete. onDragUpdate is
  /// called as touches move updating the scale as determined by the first
  /// two points. onDragEnd is called when the last touch event lifts and the
  /// velocity is calculated from the final movement.
  ///
  /// onDragStart, onDragUpdate, and onDragEnd are also called for mouse wheel
  /// with the scale and point updated given the WheelEvent (deltaY updates the
  /// scale, deltaX updates the event point/pans).
  ///
  /// TODO: Add a "discrete" flag that tells drag listeners whether
  /// they should be expecting a series of continuous updates, or one large
  /// update. This will mostly be used to control whether we animate the chart
  /// between onDragUpdate calls.

  /// TODO: Investigate low performance of chart rendering from
  /// flutter when animation is enabled and we pinch to zoom on the chart.
